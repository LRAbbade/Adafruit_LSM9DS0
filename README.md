# Adafruit LSM9DS0 Python Module
###### Designed for use with the Raspberry Pi, and Adafruit's LSM9DS0 breakout board

This is a basic Python module for use with Adafruit's LSM9DS0 breakout board. It currently reads byte data through I2C, for all the sensors available. 

This is **raw data**, obviously â€“ but, there are some examples of how data can be fused/ used in the examples folder.

Modifications and the ability to change more settings will (probably) come soon.

Please ***don't*** steal it without giving credit!
